This library consists of functions, which will be helpful in order to work with 
credit ratings.

**pyratings** offers the following capabilities:

* Cleaning ratings for further processing, e.g. stripping off of rating watches.
* Transform long- and short-term ratings into rating scores and vice versa.
* Compute the best/second best/worst ratings on a security level basis within a
  portfolio context.
* Compute average ratings/rating scores on a portfolio level.
* Compute Weighted Average Rating Factor (WARF) on a portfolio level.
* Compute WARF buffer, i.e. distance from current WARF to the next maxWARF.

    "# Consolidate ratings\n",
    "Oftentimes, an individual security/entity has ratings from several rating agencies. For\n",
    "example, a security might have a _BBB-_ rating from S&P, a _BBB_ rating from Fitch, and\n",
    "a _Ba1_ rating from Moody's.<br>\n",
    "Now, let's imagine your investment guidelines only allow investments in securities\n",
    "that have an investment grade rating, i.e. _Baa3/BBB-_ at a minimum. You might wonder\n",
    " which of the attached ratings is relevant? Is this particular security regarded as\n",
    " investment grade (as S&P and Fitch are indicating) or is it already a junk bond (as\n",
    " implied by Moody's)? â€” Well, there's no definitive answer, it simply depends.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to answer this question. **pyratings** offers the following three functions in order to consolidate multiple ratings into a final rating:\n",
    "\n",

    "Choose the best rating among all rating agencies. That's the aggressive way.\n",
    "2. [``get_second_best_ratings``](../../api_reference/#pyratings.consolidate.get_second_best_ratings)\n",
    "Choose the second-best rating among all rating agencies. That's a less aggressive way.\n",
    "3. [``get_worst_ratings``](../../api_reference/#pyratings.consolidate.get_worst_ratings)\n",
    "Choose the worst rating among all rating agencies. That's the conservative way."
